ModernUT is a chrome extension which applies a modern-looking theme and style to the websites of Univeristy Of Tehran.
<h2>How to install it?</h2>
Download the repository as a ZIP file and load it as an unpacked extension to your Chrome:
<ol>
	<li>You can find the ZIP source code of the extension from the code section above. Download it and extract it.</li>
	<li>Go the Extensions settings in your Chrome-based browser.</li>

<h2>How to contribute?</h2>
<p>Since the project is in its early stages, all contributions would be super helpful. Let me know if you discover that any of the applied styles or scripts cause problems or disruptions in the functionality of websites. If you have issues installing the extension or the extension doesn't seem to work after installation please report it in the issues section. Also if you're familiar with CSS and JavaScript and want to make some changes to the extensions send a merge request. I will definitely consider merging your code into the project.</p>
